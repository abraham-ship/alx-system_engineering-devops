You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
Issues with the one server web infrastructure 

1. SPOF(Single point of failure): 
SPOF refers to any non-redundant part of a system that, if dysfunctional, would cause the entire system to fail. There's a single point of failure in this architecture caused by the lack of redundancy and any single failure in any part of the system will cause all the system to stop.
 2. Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted): 
In case a web server is restarted when new code is deployed it will lead to the website being temporarily unavailable. 
3. Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic:
 This architecture cannot scale because it lacks the ability to handle a huge number of requests since it has no other server to redirect the traffic to.
